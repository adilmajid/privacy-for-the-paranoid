# Step-by-step guide to setting up 1Password

## Summary
This will be a pain to set up, but you will only have to do it once

### Desktop Setup
* Go to www.1password.com
* Set up your account
* Come up with a Master Password that is 30+ characters long. Ideally a sentence that is 5-6 words long with spaces. (A coherent sentence is easy for you to remember, but difficult to be brute-forced by a machine. Upper/lower case, numbers, and special characters do not matter.)
* Download your Emergency Kit and print it. Write your Master Password on it
* IMPORTANT: After printing your Emergency Kit, put it somewhere safe
* IMPORTANT: After printing your Emergency Kit, delete it from your computer, and empty your trash immediately.
* Download the desktop app
* Set up the Browser Extension for your browser: https://1password.com/downloads/
* Start adding your passwords!

### Adding your passwords
* Go to the website for the password you wish to add to 1password
* Log in. The 1Password Extension will ask if you want to save that password. Say yes. The password is saved!

### iOS Setup
* Go to the App Store
* Download 1Password
* Log in by scanning the code on your Emergency Kit
* Set up "Autofill Passwords". Directions are provided as soon as you sign in to the app.
* When setting up "Autofill Passwords", make sure you un-select "Keychain" and ONLY select 1Password
* When setting up "Autofill Passwords", make sure you enable "Auto-copy One-time Passwords"
* When finished, go back to 1Password
* The app will prompt you to set up Face ID or Touch ID. Say OK.
* Go to Settings > Security. Change "Auto Lock" from 10 minutes to 1 minute.
* Go to Settings > Advanced > Security. Change "Require Master Password" from Never to After Device Restart.

### Actually Using 1Password
* On Desktop: when logging in on a website, select the "username" field and hit Command+\
* On Mobile: tap the "username" field and the keyboard will appear. At the top of the keyboard, it will show you the 1Password options.

### Recommendations
* Never access 1password via the browser
* Never log into 1password on somebody else's computer
* Disable Chrome/Safari/iOS from automatically saving your passwords. Delete any saved passwords. Use 1Password exclusively.
