# Online Security and Privacy for the Paranoid
A master checklist to secure your online life.

##Beginner

###Secure Logins
* [ ] Set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) on all of your accounts that support it.
* [ ] Set up login notifications on apps/services that allow it
* [ ] Use a password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com). Change the master password periodically.
* [ ] Use different passwords for all of your accounts
* [ ] Generate secure passwords [LastPass Generate](https://lastpass.com/generate)
* [ ] Use [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) to see if any of your accounts have been compromised
* [ ] Update login information (or entirely delete the account) for compromised accounts
* [ ] Delete your all of your unused and unnecessary accounts
* [ ] On services that allow it, check for active sessions, and delete any unused, forgotten, or unapproved sessions


###Secure Browsing
* [ ] Pay attention to when a website is using https, and never type a password into a site that doesn't use https
* [ ] Use a browser plugin like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), privacy badger, and ghostery to prevent third parties from tracking you
* [ ] Switch away from Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and use [Firefox](www.firefox.com) or [Brave](www.brave.com) instead
* [ ] Set cookies, history, etc to delete after 30 days (or less!)


###Bank / Payments
* [ ] Use [Privacy.com](http://privacy.com) when doing online transactions and enable transaction notifications
* [ ] Disable paper bank statement mailings


###Your Phone
* [ ] Disable TouchID / fingerprint unlock
* [ ] Set a passcode / password of 6+ characters
* [ ] Disable what someone can see/do with your phone if they don't have the password (lock screen widgets, notification privacy, Apple/Android/Samsung Pay)
* [ ] Disable location services for any app that doesn't really need it. Disable "always on" location services from literally everything.
* [ ] Get rid of your Android and get an iPhone (not intentionally pretentious, && there are great iPhones at basically any price point these days)


###Your Computer
* [ ] Cover your computer webcam with a Post-it
* [ ] Install [Micro Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/microsnitch/index.html) to monitor when your webcam and microphone are turned on
* [ ] Install [Malwarebyte](http://malwarebytes.org) on your computer, and run it periodically
* [ ] Turn on Firewall on your Mac
* [ ] Set Mac lockscreen notifications to private
* [ ] For the super-paranoid, not tied to Mac or Windows: use [QUBES OS](https://www.qubes-os.org) or [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org)


###Other
* [ ] Secure your Skype account if you need it. Delete it if you don't. (Good alternative is Google Duo, which saves some metadata but has encrypted calls.)
* [ ] Delete your Yahoo account. If you need it for Flickr, set a long password, set up 2FA, and enable login notifications
* [ ] Set strict privacy options on Facebook (see below)
* [ ] Set strict privacy options on Google (see below)
* [ ] Don't buy knockoff smart home appliances. This includes security cameras
* [ ] Get rid of your Amazon Alexa and Google Home


##Advanced

###Secure Browsing
* [ ] Use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) for web browsing. The more people use it the better the network is
* [ ] Use [Firefox Focus](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1055677337) on iOS
* [ ] Use [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org) to test whether your browser setup is safe against tracking
* [ ] Don't use unsecured wifi networks without a VPN
* [ ] Install a VPN client on your computer ([VyprVPN](https://www.goldenfrog.com/vyprvpn) is a good one)
* [ ] Install [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) to monitor outgoing connections (basically a reverse Firewall).

###Secure Communication
* [ ] Use encrypted communication methods - [Signal](https://whispersystems.org), etc.
* [ ] Make sure that any device or app you store sensitive info in is encrypted.  (Evernote, Day One, etc.)

###Secure Your Offline Life
* [ ] Consolidate external hard drives and USB thumbdrives so you don't lose them
* [ ] Consolidate notebooks and papers that could have sensitive info, shred the ones you don't need. Archive papers by scanning into (a secured) Evernote account if you don't need the physical copy.
* [ ] Wipe unused old computers, phones, etc.


##Google
